This is my fina project of embedded systems course in IUST.
This is project is about simulation of heart beat sensor with arduino and show its result on LED and then send result to phone with blynk application.
Steps:

1- Donwload virtual serial port app on laptop and blynk app on phone. create account on blynk app then recieve auth token and add it later to your project

2- Go to virtual serial port app

3- Create pair between COM3 and COM1

4- Then go to below address

"C:\Users\Asus\Documents\Arduino\libraries\blynk-library-0.6.1\scripts"

5- Then enter this command "blynk-ser.bat -c COM1 -p 8442"

6- Then go to blynk app and design your shematics and then press plat button.

Good Luck
